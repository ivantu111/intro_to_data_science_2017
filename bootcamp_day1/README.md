# Morning
## Setup 

Follow the instruction in class01 to set up the environment and clone the github

### TODO

* download anaconda (30 minutes)
* setup conda environment. name it `itds_bootcamp`. (30 minutes)


```
to set up conda environment follow the instruction in class01.
go into the environment you created. you should see your command line prompt has the environment name specified at the beginning.
```

* fork Tian's github and clone it to your local machine. (30 minutes) 


```
"Fork" is done through the github website. 
Clone is done through the command line. 
	To learn how to clone, follow instruction in class01.
Be conscious about where you put/cloned the folder. the location you executed "git clone" is the location of the intro_to_data_science_2017 folder.
```

* Students who participate in the previous classes:
	
	```
	if you need to keep anything in the repo you forked before:
		let me know. We will figure out a way to preserve yours. (you can keep a local copy and move the ones you want to a the new fork later.)
	else:
	do the following
	1. Please delete the repo you forked before. (delete the local copy as well if you wish. you don't have to.)
	2. Fork my repo again. 
	Due to student turn over we experienced in the past, we will gather and contribute all teams' work back to class repo on the last day of the bootcamp.
	```

## Hackerrank
[Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com) is a very good resource for us to practice coding. It is not just for python. You can also practice SQL, Java, C++ etc. 

### TODO
1. create an account at hackerrank. (you can use your google, facebook, etc.)
2. [warmup](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms/warmup)
3. students who still have time:

```
1. play with hackerrank. find a sufficiently challenging problem on hackerrank.
2. write it in ".py" script. have the link to that problem and your name in the script. 
3. demo to other students.
```

4. those who finished the ".py" script will demo the script to other student.

```
send them to me (tian.su.science@gmail.com).
Since we are not using github to contribute to class work yet, I will save them to the main repo. 
```
